## Problem Description

<p>Given the <code>head</code> of a linked list, return <em>the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return </em><code>null</code>.</p>

<p>There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the <code>next</code> pointer. Internally, <code>pos</code> is used to denote the index of the node that tail's <code>next</code> pointer is connected to (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). It is <code>-1</code> if there is no cycle. <strong>Note that</strong> <code>pos</code> <strong>is not passed as a parameter</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Do not modify</strong> the linked list.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png" style="height: 145px; width: 450px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> tail connects to node index 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" style="height: 105px; width: 201px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2], pos = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> tail connects to node index 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" style="height: 65px; width: 65px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1], pos = -1
<strong>Output:</strong> no cycle
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no cycle in the linked list.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>pos</code> is <code>-1</code> or a <strong>valid index</strong> in the linked-list.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Can you solve it using <code>O(1)</code> (i.e. constant) memory?</p>

* `slow` moves 1 step at a time, `fast` moves 2 steps at a time.
* when `slow` and `fast` meet each other, they must be on the cycle
	* `x` denotes the length of the linked list before starting the circle
	* `y` denotes the distance from the start of the cycle to where `slow` and `fast` met 
	* `C` denotes the length of the cycle
	* when they meet, slow traveled `(x + y)` steps while `fast` traveled `2 * (x + y)` steps, and the extra distance `(x + y)` must be a multiple of the circle length `C`
		* note that `x`, `y`, `C` are all lengths or the number of steps need to move. 
		* `head`, `slow`, `fast` are pointers. 
		* `head` moves `x` steps and arrives at the start of the cycle.
* so we have `x + y = N * C`, let `slow` continue to travel from `y` and after `x` more steps, `slow` will return to the start of the cycle.
* At the same time, according to the definition of x, `head` will also reach the start of the cycle after moving `x` steps.
* so if `head` and `slow` start to move at the same time, they will meet at the start of the cycle, that is the answer.
